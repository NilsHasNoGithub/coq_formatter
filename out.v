    This file has to be a valid script, meaning that it
    can be executed by Coq.
    Therefore, explanations in natural language have to be between
    comment markers.

    In this project template, text within square brackets (within
    comment markers) is intended to clarify what needs to be
    written where.

    In the final version, we expect that all these blocks have been
    replaced by (your) proper content.

(*
Abstract:
=========
[
    Explain whether you managed to prove the correctness theorem.
    And how did that go: did you have to change a lot compared to
    the original model as it was before you started with the proof,
    or could you use your formalization without many modifications?

Focus:


Modeling Goal:
==============
[Verification model]


Fragment of reality:
====================
[
Our model will focus on the user of the camera, the camera itself,
and the visual representation of the world within the scope of the lens
and the film inside of the camera.
]


Perspective:
============
[
Save selected visual state of world within the scope of the lens on film.
]

(*
Abstractions or simplifications:
================================
[
    Depending on the chosen focus, you may simplify certain aspects of
    your artifact.
    If you are modeling some kind of home automation system, it is not
    unreasonable to assume that the net power is constant, although this
    is not exactly the case in reality. However, if you are modeling an
    artifact that protects against high peaks of power, these fluctuations
    should be part of the model.

    Write down explicitly which assumptions you have made to simplify
    the artifact.
]

We have chosen not to model the viewfinder of the camera.
We did this because we thought it would add unnecessary complexity that doesn't really help prove what we're trying to prove.

Meaning Camera:

For any three subsequent points in time and any shutter, aperture and focus setting, 
if at the first point in time the lever is pulled, and at the second point in time the aperture, 
shutter and, focus settings are set and are not changed until the shutter button is pressed, 
and if we press the shutter button no earlier or later than the third point in time, 
then the photo is saved on film after a short time after the third point in time that is associated with the chosen shutter speed setting.

    Here you have to specify:

    OUTSIDE comment markers:
    - The 'Definition' to be read by Coq, in a readable layout that
    matches the mathematical structure of the formula.

    WITHIN comment markers:
    - The specification of the overall system in natural language.
    Obviously, this specification should be consistent with the
    formula used by Coq.
    - If appropriate, a short explanation in natural language about
    the choices that have been made.

(* Extras *)

(*
[
    It is very likely that you do not need any extras!

    However, if it turns out during your proof that you have to prove
    several times (almost) the same, then you may define a 'Lemma' at
    this place, followed by its proof. And in the proof of the correctness
    theorem, you may apply this lemma several times.
    Note that it is always allowed to add lemmas to this script!

    Sometimes it happens that Coq has troubles with 'trivial' properties
    of numbers, that cannot be solve easily using 'lin_solve'.
    In such situations, you may contact your supervisor and discuss
    whether this may be solved by adding an 'Axiom', which can also be
    applied later on within the proof of the correctness theorem.
]
*)

(* Correctness theorem *)

(* ====================================================================== *)

(*
[
    Write down your correctness theorem in the usual notation:
    Theorem CorTheorem:
    Component1 /\ Component2 /\ ... /\ ComponentN -> SpecOfTheOverallSystem.

    Note that as long as you don't know what natural deduction is
    and you cannot start with the proof yet, you should keep this
    theorem within comment markers, otherwise you will get a red cross
    for stating a theorem without a proof.

    For the final version you obviously have to remove these comment
    markers and provide a real proof!

    Note that even if your proof is correct, you won't be able to
    get a green check mark, but only an orange flag, for technical
    reasons. But that is no problem.
